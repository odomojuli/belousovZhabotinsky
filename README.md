# belousovZhabotinsky
This is my modification of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction-diffusion system

Read about it here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction

Based on the Processing code of:

"A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE BELOUSOV-ZHABOTINSKY REACTION FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES"
By Alasdair Turner (2009)

And the noise algorithm in "An image Synthesizer" by Ken Perlin (1985).
